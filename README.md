This is a simple Python program to manage a library’s books. It allows you to add new books, search for books by title, issue books to users, return books, and view the entire library inventory. The program saves all data in a catalog.json file so that the library records are preserved between sessions, and it also keeps a library.log file to record all issued and returned books.
